Some explanations:

1. I have divided the code in several files to keep this simple :)

2. There is a master file named "do_all.R". This file will download and/or load datasets, process information and create a csv file named "tidy_all.csv" that contains all the information at all levels with a column that shows if the row i^th refers to a region, provincia or comuna. This file also calls the files "household_tables_xxx.R" (read item 3 for more information about the separated levels files)

3. The files "household_tables_xxx.R" (xxx can be "region", "provincia" or "comuna") will download and/or load datasets, process information and create csv files named "tidy_all_region.csv", "tidy_all_provincia.csv" and "tidy_comuna.csv". Those files are separated at levels and include a final pa\u00eds's row (country's row) that is a measure considering all the entities at the indicated level (i.e. is not an average of averages!). You can run, for example "household_tables_region.R" if you are not interested in other level than region.
