# Pre-Database Processing for Data Chile Raw Data

## Other datasets

  - [Geographic location of all (most?) schools in Chile](http://datos.gob.cl/dataset/448/resource/a011ad18-76f0-44e4-b8a2-c161749bb76a) â€” It's probably feasible to join it with the *matricula* and *rendimiento* datasets.
  - There's a gov't website with school performance data. I guess the source of the data is the same as the *rendimiento* dataset: http://www.simce.cl/ficha/?rbd=8530
